## DeNoise

Coding part is not yet done by me. I am still working on the courses that we were told to learn and doing some assignments and problems in that courses. Until now I have learnt the following courses:

- `ML Course` by google to learn the basics of machine learning.
- `Udacity` course on `Tensor Flow` to learn implementation of neural network and tensor flow.
- Tutorials on `Resnet` architecture to learn about the implementation of Resnet.
- Tutorials on `GAN` to learn about the implementation of GANs.
- Right now am learning `Sequence Models` , a course offered by Coursera Deep Learning.
